# Source for dtms example data

Christian Dudel, dudel@demogr.mpg.de

This repository contains the source for the two example data sets for the R 
package dtms which is available at https://github.com/christiandudel/dtms. 

The main files are contained in the folder "Code", one file each for the two 
data sets. The work example also uses additional files from the folder "Input".
The input data contained in this folder was originally published with  https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0619-6. The folder "Functions" includes
R code which provides some helper functions used in generating the data.
